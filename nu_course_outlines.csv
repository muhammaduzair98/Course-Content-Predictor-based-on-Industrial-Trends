It is designed to enable a balanced perception of the ideological rationale, and the political factors & forces that generated events leading to the creation of Pakistan. History-centric description of events and personalities has been avoided to rationalize the course. More important is the impact that personalities and events had.  The Cotemporary Pakistan is seen as the outcome of complex political and constitutional processes that evolved during the post-independence era. Understanding of the political processes and constitutional developments that determined the nature of authoritarianism and democratic experiences in Pakistan is imperative for the study of Pakistan. Equally important is the knowing of social structures and ethnic divide, the plural character of Pakistan’s society. In addition, the main strands of Pakistan’s foreign policy are to be examined in the context of historical constraints, geo-strategic location and stresses of contemporary world. Based on this perspective, a futuristic scenario of Pakistan will be explored. Pakistan Studies, therefore, should act as a window to future."

Business Communication I is designed to provide undergraduates with a thorough understanding of how communication works within the business environment. The course starts with a brief history of what communication is, and how communication is the foundation for human development through social, political and business organization. Students are introduced to fundamental business structures such as business hierarchies and stakeholder groups in order to understand who we communicate with. However, the main focus of Business Communication I is on how we communicate through different types of written communication, and to understand which type is appropriate to each situation and why. One third of the course is theoretical (style, formatting, grammar and types of types of communication such as emails, memos, letters, proposals, and reports) and two thirds practical (case-based writing exercises in class and through assignments) to develop analytical and writing skills.
